Effects for generating images via the browser.

## Pages

- `blurrydots.html`: Creates a misty field of soft, blurred dots. Use the controls to tweak density, layers, size, blur, and light, then export as PNG.
- `clouds.html`: Generates layered, realistic cloud formations with adjustable color, density, and lighting. The result fills the canvas and can be exported.
- `lines.html`: WebGL2-based waterpipe-style ribbon lines with additive glow. Supports multi-direction background gradients, dual line colors, scale X/Y, and PNG export.
