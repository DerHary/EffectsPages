# EffectsPages
A small collection of standalone HTML pages for generating high‑quality visual textures directly in the browser. Each page renders a full‑screen effect with an on‑screen control panel and can export a PNG at custom dimensions.

## Pages

- `blurrydots.html`: A soft, atmospheric dot field with layered blur. Ideal for subtle, misty backdrops; controls focus on density, layers, size, blur, and light.
- `clouds.html`: Realistic, volumetric cloud formations built from layered puffs. Tune color, density, and lighting to create anything from calm haze to dramatic skies.
- `lines.html`: WebGL2 ribbon‑line generator. Features dual color mixing, multi‑direction background gradients, axis scaling, and export controls for print‑ready output.
